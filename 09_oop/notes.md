# JavaScript and Classes

There are no classes and objects in js because js is the prototype-based-language but now we can use classes that comes with ES6.

Q. Does JS have Classes? (GPT Response)
A. Yes, JavaScript does have classes, but they are somewhat different from classes in traditional object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++. JavaScript classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a more straightforward and syntactically cleaner way to create objects and handle inheritance compared to the prototype-based inheritance that was previously used.
